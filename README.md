## Description

In this challenge, I created an index.js file that allows the project creator to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Details

The project creator should install the Inquirer package (8.2.4) prior to starting the process of generating a professional README file using the command-line application. The application is invoked by the following command: node index.js. When the project is complete, then as a developer I can use the application to generate a README so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
